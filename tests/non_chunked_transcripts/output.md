 Am I on?

There we go.

I don't have to shout now.

My first PyCon was Cleveland 2018.

Actually, Cleveland is not too far from here.

Changed my life.

Like, that was the first major conference I spoke at.

I didn't realize how big PyCon was.

I was like, oh, boy, they accepted me to speak.

And then I show up and I'm speaking to a room of like hundreds of people.

I'm like, oh, shoot.

But that was pretty awesome.

Since then, I've traveled the world speaking at different conferences.

Lots of times about testing, sometimes about programming, sometimes about various other topics.

Yes.

I remember PyCon 2018.

This was in the before time, in the before COVID when money was still free.

I remember Instagram, Facebook invited a whole bunch of speakers to like a dinner.

I'm like, oh, cool.

It's going to be like happy hour.

I'll get a free drink and maybe they have appetizers.

I don't know.
