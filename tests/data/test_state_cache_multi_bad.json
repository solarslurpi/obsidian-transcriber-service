The first is by exploring my notes and this could be by using the search pane, or by  using the Quickswitcher, or my favorite is Excalibrate.  Excalibrate lets me examine the links and relationships between notes.  The second way that I do this is through using Data View Queries.  Here to Data View Queries that I use, one tells me the notes by the number of outgoing  links and the top 10 of that is going to show me the maps of content that I already have  that I might want to elaborate on.  This one is notes by number of incoming links, so notes that I am linking to a lot in  other notes.  And the third way is by using randomness to have Obsidian Resurface notes that maybe you  hadn't considered working on.  If you want more details on this, I'm going to leave a link in the description below, do a  video that I made on emergent note taking.",

When I show in my videos, the front matter I have and the links and how I take notes already with the links,  that presents a false impression that that's what I did from the beginning. It is not.  In the beginning, I didn't know anything about front matter or what kind of connections were going to be important,  and I didn't even use links because one of the things Obsidian is really good at is that it shows you the unlinked mentions.  So you can just type it normally and then if you decide to make something a link in the future,  then it's not like those connections are lost. Obsidian will show you those in the unlinked references.  So I would recommend that you start like I did with as few front matter and links and systems as you can get away with  and then I think you'll eventually find your way to one that works for you. Good luck!",

If you don't have dedicated time to zoom out,  you're going to get stuck in these patterns  that keep on repeating.  And typically, whatever was there,  like whatever opportunity,  it's not going to stay the same size.  It actually might start getting smaller over time,  because you're just kind of in the same rut.  You're just kind of spinning your wheels in the same rut.  Instead, what you need to do is zoom out.  Like you need to have time to go on a personal retreat  and do a life audit and get this like zoom out  on your life.  Go to a different space.  And that is going to lead to so many more aha moments.  And deeper, calm and understanding,  than simply doing the same stuff that's leading to burnout.",
