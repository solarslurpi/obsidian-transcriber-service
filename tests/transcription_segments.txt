[0.00s -> 3.00s]  This is the Blue Lab Pulse Meter.
[3.00s -> 7.00s]  I'm very excited to be able to add it to our lineup of products at KISS Organics,
[7.00s -> 9.00s]  and we have the best price online.
[9.00s -> 13.00s]  This meter is not for everyone, but here's what it does.
[13.00s -> 20.00s]  It measures moisture, conductivity, or EC, and temperature directly in the root zone with one click.
[20.00s -> 25.00s]  It connects to the Blue Lab Pulse app to view, analyze, and store all your measurement data,
[25.00s -> 29.00s]  the apps available in English, Spanish, Dutch, German, and Korean,
[29.00s -> 36.00s]  and it has a built-in depth gauge to get consistent measurements with every reading.
[36.00s -> 42.00s]  It works in soil, cocoa core, nutrient solution, and living soils.
[42.00s -> 45.00s]  So, how and why would you want something like this for your garden?
[45.00s -> 48.00s]  Well, first off, it will quickly measure moisture levels.
[48.00s -> 51.00s]  It is waterproof, unlike the Blue Map Moisture Meter,
[51.00s -> 53.00s]  and I love that I can get a reading immediately
[53.00s -> 56.00s]  instead of having to wait for a while between readings.
[56.00s -> 61.00s]  This means I can use one meter and check multiple pots or beds in a matter of seconds
[61.00s -> 64.00s]  to see how evenly I'm watering, or if I have any dry spots,
[64.00s -> 66.00s]  or if any containers got missed when watering.
[66.00s -> 69.00s]  Secondly, it tells me EC.
[69.00s -> 72.00s]  EC is a measurement of electrical conductivity in your soil,
[72.00s -> 76.00s]  which is a good way of seeing what level of fertility you have in your media.
[76.00s -> 80.00s]  Cat ions like calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and ammonium,
[80.00s -> 84.00s]  as well as anions like sulfur, chloride, nitrates, and bicarbonates
[84.00s -> 87.00s]  are all salts that, when dissolved in solution in soils,
[87.00s -> 89.00s]  will carry electrical charges in current.
[89.00s -> 93.00s]  Now, too high of an EC will potentially put osmotic pressure on your roots,
[93.00s -> 95.00s]  and that can be bad.
[95.00s -> 97.00s]  So it's about getting it into the proper range,
[97.00s -> 99.00s]  and we really want a soil test so we can determine
[99.00s -> 102.00s]  what is making up the salt concentration in our soil.
[102.00s -> 105.00s]  But it will give us a rough idea of fertility in our soil mix
[105.00s -> 107.00s]  if we know all our inputs.
[107.00s -> 111.00s]  And staying within certain EC ranges, typically 0.7 to 2.8,
[111.00s -> 115.00s]  will allow for good microbial activity and important soil processes
[115.00s -> 117.00s]  like respiration and decomposition.
[117.00s -> 121.00s]  Keep in mind that several factors can affect soil EC,
[121.00s -> 125.00s]  such as moisture content, soil structure, and the presence of dissolved salts.
[125.00s -> 129.00s]  As the soil moisture increases, so will your EC.
[129.00s -> 131.00s]  And lastly, I get an idea of temperature.
[131.00s -> 134.00s]  Cold root zone temperatures can inhibit plant growth
[134.00s -> 137.00s]  and the uptake of many essential nutrients like phosphorus
[137.00s -> 141.00s]  and too high of soil temps can make it easier for plant pathogens to grow.
[141.00s -> 144.00s]  I'm currently calibrating it with my BlueMap moisture meter
[144.00s -> 147.00s]  and we'll be comparing it with an arrometer here soon.
[150.00s -> 153.00s]  Okay, so this is the iPhone app that comes along with it.
[153.00s -> 155.00s]  You can use it on Android as well though.
[155.00s -> 157.00s]  The app is called Pulse.
[157.00s -> 159.00s]  Again, it's available in multiple languages.
[159.00s -> 164.00s]  And essentially, I just push the button on the Pulse meter itself
[164.00s -> 165.00s]  to connect it.
[165.00s -> 167.00s]  It connects quickly via Bluetooth.
[167.00s -> 171.00s]  And then at that point, I don't have to keep reconnecting with every calibration
[171.00s -> 174.00s]  or every photo I want to take.
[174.00s -> 177.00s]  I just click the measure button and then I can go in as I'm doing here
[177.00s -> 182.00s]  and I can add a photo to that measurement as well as any notes that I may want.
[182.00s -> 187.00s]  So here's a good place I can add, say, the VPD in the room at the time.
[187.00s -> 191.00s]  Any pest pressures I may be dealing with when I watered
[191.00s -> 195.00s]  and keep track of all of that right here in the app.
[195.00s -> 199.00s]  So it's a nice little kind of like journal in some ways.
[199.00s -> 202.00s]  Now this could get complicated in a facility where you have multiple plants
[202.00s -> 205.00s]  and things like that, but you do have the ability to export the data.
[205.00s -> 208.00s]  So if you had a facility, for example, you could just measure one room,
[208.00s -> 212.00s]  export that data and then keep the files somewhere else associated with it.
[212.00s -> 214.00s]  But since I just have them using it in this room,
[214.00s -> 217.00s]  I can go back through historically and look at my notes.
[217.00s -> 220.00s]  And anytime you see an orange dot there next to the recording,
[220.00s -> 224.00s]  that tells me that I took a picture or added extra notes.
[224.00s -> 227.00s]  So that's a really handy feature to quickly go back through
[227.00s -> 232.00s]  and look at what was going on in the room at that time for tracking things.
[232.00s -> 235.00s]  So again, not for everyone, but if you're into data,
[235.00s -> 241.00s]  this is a really cool tool that could potentially help you in your grow.
[241.00s -> 247.00s]  And so you can see what I was doing here was I was comparing the 35% moisture
[247.00s -> 252.00s]  in this case correlated approximately with my blue matte moisture meter.
[252.00s -> 255.00s]  At that point it said I was at about 75 m bar.
[255.00s -> 258.00s]  Now I've been playing around with this for a little while
[258.00s -> 263.00s]  and getting a bunch of measurements to kind of get an idea of EC and moisture level
[263.00s -> 267.00s]  and how those things relate to say something like the blue matte moisture meter.
[267.00s -> 273.00s]  And I find I probably want to be around 35 to 45% is a moisture range.
[273.00s -> 276.00s]  And that probably correlates to about 80.
[276.00s -> 281.00s]  Let's say 70 to 90 in terms of m bar ratings.
[281.00s -> 284.00s]  But one other cool feature here I can now export this data.
[284.00s -> 290.00s]  I can send it to someone or I can save it to a file or email it to myself.
[290.00s -> 295.00s]  And I think that's another really great feature associated with this.
[295.00s -> 298.00s]  You can configure it based on the type of media you're using.
[298.00s -> 302.00s]  In this case, I just configured it to a mixed media for living soil.
[302.00s -> 303.00s]  Well, that's it.
[303.00s -> 305.00s]  That's the blue lab pulse meter.
[305.00s -> 309.00s]  I covered the pros and cons as well as why someone might want to use this tool in their garden.
[309.00s -> 311.00s]  Thanks for checking out my review.
[311.00s -> 316.00s]  And you can go to kisorganics.com to learn more or order one for yourself.
[316.00s -> 317.00s]  Thanks.
